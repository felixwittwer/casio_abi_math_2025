## Installation
### fx-9860 GII
1. [Download](https://edu.casio.com/dl/) and install the Casio FA-124 Programm

Due to the complexety of the program I won't explain every detail in this README. For further information use the [official manual (German)](https://support.casio.com/storage/de/manual/pdf/DE/004/FA-124_DE.pdf).

### fx-9860 GIII
1. Connect Casio fx-9860 GIII to your Computer with the help of the USB cable.

**On the Calculator:** <br>

2. Press [F1].

**On your machine:** <br>

3. Open the file manager of your operating system and copy all [.g1m](#program_files) files into the shown device (usually D:) under D:/@MainMem/PROGRAM.

4. Eject device (usually D:). More info on calculator display.

**On the Calculator:** <br>

5. Press [EXE] as shown on the screen. <br>
6. Press [EXIT] as shown on the screen. <br>
7. Press [MENU] as shown on the screen. <br>

**Note**
Installation is also possible via the 3-Pin cable from one calculator to another. Transfer is also possible between different [compatible](#compatibility) calculator generations.

## How to use
To use the Progam you have to execute the ABI 2025.g1m file by:

**On the Calculator:** <br>
1. go into the Program menu [B]
2. execute the ABI 2025 file [EXE]

All the other files are used by the program automaticaly and you are getting redirected during execution. So don't rename them!

For a detailed List/Map of the included functionality see [menu_structure](/menu_structure.txt)
